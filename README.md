# Welcome to FoodHUB.

We have created a restaurant application called FoodHub to help customers make reservations at restaurants and help managers keep their employee data in one place. With this project we aimed to connect customers and restaurants as well as allow restaurants to take control of their business. 


Our application offers a seamless design for restaurant customers and managers.
The login page allows you to select what type of user you are, whether you are a customer or a manager, and what restaurant you would like to see. Once you are logged in, all information you deal with will be related to the restaurant you have chosen.

After logging in as a customer, you are able to make a reservation at a table at that restaurant Once the reservation is completed, you are able to see table information such as number of seats. In addition, all reservations are shown in a table below allowing you to see reservations you have made at the restaurant. Finally, this page also offers a list of “perfect customers”, who are customers that have sat at every table in a restaurant.

As a manager, you are able to add new employees, update any employee information, and find hourly salary and weekly hours worked information. You are also able to search for employees given specific user input. You are able to view all the employee information or just certain fields that you would like to see.  In addition, you are able to compute the min, max, and average of hours worked. And compute the number of employees whose hours are less than the min, max or average of all employees grouped by their roles. Lastly, you are able to delete the restaurant which also deletes all of the employees and tables at that restaurant.
